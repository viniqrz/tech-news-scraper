How browsers work 🌐, Claude Code on the go 📱, lessons from 14 years at Google 🎓 
Essential user management features for startups (Sponsor)
Startups need solid user management from day one: authentication (passwords, OAuth, magic links), authorization with role-based access control, profile management, and security essentials like MFA and session handling. These features directly impact conversion rates, reduce support tickets, and keep you compliant with data protection regulations.

This guide breaks down what to prioritize based on your stage, when to use an auth provider versus building in-house, and how to avoid common pitfalls like insecure password storage or broken session management.

Critical reading if you're evaluating auth solutions or planning your user management architecture. Get the guide

How Browsers Work (7 minute read)
This interactive guide provides a simplified mental model of how browsers function, using small, interactive examples. It explains how browsers process URLs, convert them into HTTP requests, and resolve domain names into IP addresses using DNS. A reliable TCP connection is established to the server for sending HTTP requests and receiving responses. Finally, the browser parses HTML to build the DOM tree and render the page through layout, paint, and composite stages.
Software rendering in 500 lines of bare C++ (3 minute read)
This article series makes modern 3D graphics APIs understandable through building a simplified software renderer in bare C++ from scratch. The project has about 500 lines of code and requires no third-party graphics libraries. The series starts with basic pixel manipulation and TGA file handling, then moves on to manually learning to draw lines, triangles, and perform complex rendering tasks.

Opinions & Advice
Shipping at Inference-Speed (8 minute read)
AI-powered coding has accelerated this dev's software development speed, with GPT-5/5.2 Codex being a major breakthrough that allows them to ship code at "inference-speed.” This means they are limited mainly by AI processing time rather than human coding ability. GPT's Codex takes longer to start (sometimes 10-15 minutes reading code), but it produces more reliable results than Claude's Opus, which works faster but often requires fixes. They now rarely read the code they produce, instead focusing on high-level architecture decisions and letting AI handle most implementation details.
What The Best Engineers Do—and What Actually Got Them Promoted, from an Amazon VP (8 minute read)
According to former Amazon VP Ethan Evans, the best engineers who get promoted aren't just great coders, but those who make the entire organization better by focusing on business impact rather than just technical excellence. The top engineers fully ship products (not just demos), make the organization faster through high productivity and proactivity, do their share of unglamorous work, help others succeed, and communicate properly about customer impact.
21 Lessons From 14 Years at Google (12 minute read)
After 14 years at Google, Addy Osmani has found value in obsessing over solving user problems, collaborating to get to the right answer together, and having a strong bias towards action and shipping clear, simple solutions. Clarity is more important than cleverness, and it's always good to question the necessity of new code.

How Sentry built its AI Code Review: architecture, context, quality, and evals (Sponsor)
Tinkering with agentic AI? Check out this technical deep dive by the Sentry engineering team to learn how they built a context-aware agent that uses prod data to predict bugs. Read the blog
React Grab (GitHub Repo)
React Grab improves the accuracy and speed of AI coding agents by allowing devs to directly select UI element context from their React apps. Users can hover over any UI element and press a hotkey (⌘C or Ctrl+C) to copy its file name, React component, and HTML source code. This capability provides precise context to AI tools, making them much faster and more accurate in understanding and modifying code.
The C3 Programming Language (3 minute read)
C3 is a safe programming language designed as an evolution of C, building on its syntax and semantics. It has full C ABI compatibility, allowing for easy integration with existing C/C++ projects without special considerations. C3 includes a simple module system, precise operator overloading, powerful compile-time macros, gradual contracts, zero-overhead error handling, and generic modules.
taws (GitHub Repo)
taws is a terminal UI for interacting with AWS resources. It lets users navigate, observe, and manage their infrastructure directly from the command line. taws has a keyboard-driven interface with real-time updates, multi-profile/region support, and coverage for over 94 resource types across more than 60 AWS services.

The Dictator's Handbook and the politics of technical competence (13 minute read)
"The Dictator's Handbook” is a political science book that says that leaders maintain power by rewarding a coalition of insiders, with the size of this coalition determining an organization's governance style and outcomes. This framework can be applied to the internal politics of large tech companies, especially at the individual engineer and manager levels. However, unlike the book's premise, technical competence is an important "currency" in engineering, so competence politics plays a far more significant role for mid-level leaders focused on achieving tangible results.
Is Agentic Metadata the Next Infrastructure Layer? (13 minute read)
AI agents generate "agentic metadata," which includes rich data like reasoning traces, user prompts, and tool calls. This metadata is invaluable for debugging, continuous improvement, cost optimization, and governance and compliance. However, effectively collecting, storing, and operationalizing this fragmented data has a lot of challenges.

The future of agentic coding: conductors to orchestrators (30 minute read)
The future of agentic coding will transform software engineers from direct implementers into "conductors" guiding single AI assistants and increasingly into "orchestrators" managing autonomous fleets of agents to speed up software development.
